## Installation


```bash
npm install

npm run build

npm run watch

# Start the Electron app

## Notes

Pronunciation: Much like how the creator of the file format has told us that it's pronounced, 'jif'; you pronounce the name of this application, `jif-bar`.

Or: Pronounce it with a hard 'G' like 'goat' or 'golf'. Do whatever you like and don't let people tell you how to live.
